### How to use HexToFilter?

To use HexToFilter just enter your hex color, click the "Convert" button, copy the result and paste it into
your CSS stylesheet.

### Why the icon does not change to the chosen color?

For this tool to work properly, the initial color of the icon must be black. If your icon is not black, you
can prefix `brightness(0%) saturation(100%)` to your filter property to convert the icon set to black.
